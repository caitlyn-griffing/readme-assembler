# README Assembler

> If you are not willing to learn, no one can help you. If you are determined to learn, no one can stop you. -Zig Ziglar

## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it's important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include (but is not limited to) what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. This application quickly creates a README file by using command-line prompts and user input.
